        <h1>Home</h1>

        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>
            This is my first website. I will continue to update it with things I have learned
            from the appacademy bootcamp. So far, I have spent a lot of time learning HTML and
            CSS, but hopefully there will be time spent back in JavaScript and Python. I feel
            that it is important to learn everything and will take my time<br>
            to digest it all.
        </p>

        <h2>Plans</h2>
        <p>
           I hope to use the knowledge I gain here to build and design my own programs and
           with a little help<br>
           from someone I am working with, handle the UX as well. This will hopefully serve
           as a useful creative outlet for me as well.
        </p>

            This website began as a shoddy sketch in MSPaint so it will be exciting to watch it
            grow as I do.
